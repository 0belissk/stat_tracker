# Release Notes â€” v1.0.0

## Highlights
- CSV ingestion pipeline from S3 upload through SES delivery is production-ready with validation, quality checks, persistence, and notifications.
- Angular portal + Spring Boot `players-api` power manual report workflows and historical browsing.
- DynamoDB single-table design finalized with player/report/team access patterns.
- Operational runbooks, ADRs, and diagrams captured in `/docs` for on-call readiness.

## Fixes
- Allowed roster metadata columns (`playerName`, `teamId`) in the CSV validator so coaches can include blank metadata without breaking uploads.
- Added regression tests and documentation updates following the metadata validation incident.

## Known Gaps
- TODO: Parameterize CSV metadata allow-list via configuration instead of code.
- TODO: Document automated Helm/EKS deployment pipeline for the players API.
- TODO: Publish CloudWatch dashboards for ingestion SLOs and SES deliverability.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Deploy the updated `csv-validate` Lambda (`npm run build --prefix lambdas/csv-validate` then update the function code/alias).
2. Tag the repository: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0" && git push origin v1.0.0`.
3. Announce in #vsm-release with a link to these notes and the postmortem follow-up items.
